The shape of the resultant predicted gain-voltage transfer characteristic for the MCP fits well with experimental data, confirming assumption made and permitting the use of curve matching techniques to determine such important MCP parameters as the average number of active dynodes, the gain per stage, the crossover potential for the MCP wall material, the transit time through the multiplier, etc.}

The main parameters of the MCP amplifier, such as the gain factor and time resolution are strongly dependent on the work regime of the device. The saturation effects occur with a high-level input signal. In our paper these effects are studied numerically for large-area fast photo-detectors. It is shown that the saturation effect for short pulses can be reduced by introducing a thin, resistive layer between the bulk material and the emissive coating. A set of 2D and 3D numerical tools (MCP simulator, Monte Carlo simulator) was developed to simulate photo, secondary emission, fringe fields, and saturation phenomena in MCP amplifiers. The gain and time resolution dependencies on the pore size and voltage were studied numerically. The results are compared with the simulations of other authors and available experimental data.}

	abstract = {We present and discuss a time dependent solution of the transmission line model of a channel electron multiplier, introduced in a previous paper and already solved in steady-state conditions. The model is applicable to all the situations in which the multiplier input current is sufficiently large so that the statistical variations of the gain for each electron can be ignored and it does not apply to photon counting detectors. By introducing the appropriate boundary conditions the time dependent non-linear equations of the model are reduced to an integral equation in implicit form, whose solution can be calculated numerically by a perturbative approach. In this way the multiplying current signal i(z,t) and the voltage V(z,t) are found as functions of the position z along the channel, and of the time t during the pulse itself, for any arbitrary shape of the input current waveform. The important case of the amplification of input current pulses with a short duration compared to the multiplier recovery time is investigated in detail, showing that the non-linear behavior can be entirely described by a general function of a conveniently defined saturation parameter and that this function is characteristic of any uniform channel multiplier. The model is then used to investigate the recovery of the multiplier after a saturating pulse, and it is found that the gain recovery from weak or moderate saturation levels is exponential to a very good approximation, but with a time constant different from the characteristic time constant RC of the multiplier. Finally the case of pulses of arbitrary shape and duration is considered and examples are given of the amplification of step pulses and of a regular sequence of identical pulses. A remarkable feature of the model is that the solution can be calculated from the time shape of the output pulse, rather than from the input. This makes possible to implement methods for pulse restoration, i.e. for recovering the original input pulse shape from a measured saturated output.}

The obtained results confirm that ALD-coated MCP-PMTs produced by any of these manufacturers feature an unexpectedly long time needed for the gain recovery once the saturation was reached (from few minutes up to more than an hour). Despite the saturation level in terms of the average anode current for such devices may reach 0.4 μA/cm2 their use in high load accelerator-based experiments requires additional precaution to avoid driving an MCP-PMT to a saturated mode even for a short time before the start of any data taking period.}

First, we report on measurements made with single MCPs of very low resistance (≤500 kΩ) bonded to a Peltier cooler. Stable, reproducible operation for a rear-cooled MCP with 10 μm diameter channels of length-to-diameter ratio 60:1 was achieved for biases up to 1320 V. At this point, the MCP strip current was 5.1 mA and the rate of internal heat generation, 0.78 W cm−2. A maximum count rate of 108 cm−2 s−1, limited by the available intensity of UV illumination, was observed, coupled to a dark noise count rate of less than 1 cm−2 s−1. Second, we describe a substantial (up to 20-fold) improvement in count rate capability for two-stage MCP multipliers incorporating plates with gold, rather than nichrome, electrodes. We also present, in support of the experimental study, a thermal model of bonded, conductively-cooled MCPs which we use to determine critical parameters for stable detector operation.}

The ToF is required to reduce so-called pileup backgrounds that arise from multiple proton interactions in the same bunch crossing at high luminosity. The background can fake the signal of interest, and the extra rejection from the ToF allows the proton tagger to operate at the high luminosity required for measurement of the processes. The prototype detector uses fused silica bars emitting Cherenkov radiation as a relativistic particle passes through it. The emitted Cherenkov photons are detected by a micro-channel plate multi-anode Photomultiplier Tube (MCP-PMT) and processed by fast electronics.},

abstract = {The emergence of new solid-state avalanche photodetectors, e.g. SiPMs, with unprecedented timing capabilities opens new ways to profit from ultrafast and prompt photon emission in scintillators. In time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) and high energy timing detectors based on scintillators the ultimate coincidence time resolution (CTR) achievable is proportional to the square root of the scintillation rise time, decay time and the reciprocal light yield, CTR∝τrτd∕LY. Hence, the precise study of light emission in the very first tens of picoseconds is indispensable to understand time resolution limitations imposed by the scintillator. We developed a time correlated single photon counting setup having a Gaussian impulse response function (IRF) of 63ps sigma, allowing to precisely measure the scintillation rise time of various materials with 511keV excitation. In L(Y)SO:Ce we found two rise time components, the first below the resolution of our setup <10 ps and a second component being ∼380 ps. Co-doping with Ca2+ completely suppresses the slow rise component leading to a very fast initial scintillation emission with a rise time of <10ps. A very similar behavior is observed in LGSO:Ce crystals. The results are further confirmed by complementary measurements using a streak-camera system with pulsed X-ray excitation and additional 511 keV excited measurements of Mg2+ co-doped LuAG:Ce, YAG:Ce and GAGG:Ce samples.}

	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are silicon sensors with a built-in charge multiplication layer providing a gain of typically 10 to 50. Due to the combination of high signal-to-noise ratio and short rise time, thin LGADs provide good time resolutions. LGADs with an active thickness of about 45 μm were produced at CNM Barcelona. Their gains and time resolutions were studied in beam tests for two different multiplication layer implantation doses, as well as before and after irradiation with neutrons up to 1015 neq/cm2. The gain showed the expected decrease at a fixed voltage for a lower initial implantation dose, as well as for a higher fluence due to effective acceptor removal in the multiplication layer. Time resolutions below 30 ps were obtained at the highest applied voltages for both implantation doses before irradiation. Also after an intermediate fluence of 3×1014 neq/cm2, similar values were measured since a higher applicable reverse bias voltage could recover most of the pre-irradiation gain. At 1015 neq/cm2, the time resolution at the maximum applicable voltage of 620 V during the beam test was measured to be 57 ps since the voltage stability was not good enough to compensate for the gain layer loss. The time resolutions were found to follow approximately a universal function of gain for all implantation doses and fluences.}

MCP-PMTs based on two different designs were tested. The magnetic field tolerance of MCP-PMT based on a design providing independently biased voltages showed a significant improvement (up to 0.7 T) compared to the one utilizing an internal resistor chain design (up to 0.1 T), indicating the importance of individually adjustable voltages. The effects of the rotation angle of the MCP-PMT relative to the magnetic field direction and of the bias voltage between the photocathode and the top MCP were extensively investigated using the MCP-PMT based on the independently biased voltage design. It was found that the signal amplitude of the MCP-PMT exhibits an enhanced performance at a tilt angle of ±8°, due to the 8°bias angle of the MCP pores. The maximum signal amplitude was observed at different bias voltages depending on the magnetic field strength.}

abstract = {To obtain a high spatial resolution of a image intensifier based on microchannel plate (MCP), the long tail in the exit energy distribution of the output electrons (EDOE) is undesirable. The existing solution is increasing the penetration depth of the MCP output electrode, which will result in a serious gain reduction. Coating the MCP output electrode with efficient secondary electron yield (SEY) materials is supposed to be an effective approach to suppress the unfavorable tail component in the EDOE without negative effects on the gain. In our work, a three-dimensional MCP single channel model is developed in CST STUDIO SUITE to systematically investigate the dependences of the EDOE and the gain on the SEY property of the coated material, based on the Finite Integral Technique and Monte Carlo method. The results show that besides the high SEY of the coated material, the low incident energy corresponding to the peak SEY is another essential element affecting the electron yield in the final stage of multiplication and suppressing the output energy spread.}

The detection of the particle arrival time is based on generation of Cherenkov light in an L-shaped fused silica bar. In the previous version of the ToF, all bars were made of two pieces (radiator and light guide) glued together with a dedicated glue (Epotek 305). This solution suffers from additional radiation damage of glue. We adopted a new technique of bar production without the need of glue. The new bars have a higher optical throughput by a factor of 1.6, reduced fragility, and better geometrical precision.},

abstract = {We report here on a set of experiments that focus on measuring the timing performance of the Photonis miniPlanacon XPM85212/A1-S microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes along with the detector response at high event rates. The detector has a single photoelectron timing resolution of 30ps at low rates (10kHz). We show that both the gain and the timing start to deteriorate around 1MHz with 20 photoelectrons per channel at 104 target gain, giving the current per unit of area limits of 1.38 μA∕cm2 and 2.38 μA∕cm2 for the two tested devices. Photo-multiplier tubes with lower micro-channel plate resistivity exhibit a better rate capability due to the faster replenishment of the charge inside the microchannels. As we demonstrate, another method to improve the rate capability is to operate the photon detector tubes at a lower gain by reducing the supply voltage and compensating for the loss of amplitude by an additional amplification stage at the expense of the achieved timing resolution. The tube active area over which the beam is spread also plays a role since the same amount of light yields a better rate capability when spread over a larger area. The tubes exposed to high event rates showed an uncharacteristically slow recovery back to its initial gain with 80\% of the initial gain recovered only after several tens of minutes.}

The time-of-flight (ToF) detector in conjunction with a 3D silicon pixel tracker will tag and measure protons originating in central exclusive interactions p $+$ p \&\#x2192; p $+$ X $+$ p, where the two outgoing protons are scattered in the very forward directions. The ToF is required to reduce so-called pileup backgrounds that arise from multiple proton interactions in the same bunch crossing at high luminosity. The background can fake the signal of interest, and the extra rejection from the ToF allows the proton tagger to operate at the high luminosity required for the measurement of the processes. The prototype detector uses fused silica bars emitting Cherenkov radiation as a relativistic particle passes through them. The emitted Cherenkov photons are detected by a multi-anode micro-channel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) and processed by fast electronics.},

Particle position information is provided by a GEM tracker telescope, while timing is measured relative to a second MCP-PMT, identical in construction. In the inner part of the circular active area (radius r<5.5 mm) the time resolution of the two MCP-PMTs combined is better than 10 ps. The signal amplitude decreases in the outer region due to less light reaching the photocathode, resulting in a worse time resolution. The observed radial dependence is in quantitative agreement with a dedicated simulation. With this characterization, the suitability of MCP-PMTs as t0 reference detectors has been validated.}

abstract = {Allpix2 (read: Allpix Squared) is a generic, open-source software framework for the simulation of silicon pixel detectors. Its goal is to ease the implementation of detailed simulations for both single detectors and more complex setups such as beam telescopes from incident radiation to the digitised detector response. Predefined detector types can be automatically constructed from simple model files describing the detector parameters. The simulation chain is arranged with the help of intuitive configuration files and an extensible system of modules, which implement separate simulation steps such as realistic charge carrier deposition with the Geant4 toolkit or propagation of charge carriers in silicon using a drift–diffusion model. Detailed electric field maps imported from TCAD simulations can be used to precisely model the drift behaviour of charge carriers within the silicon, bringing a new level of realism to Monte Carlo based simulations of particle detectors. This paper provides an overview of the framework and a selection of different simulation modules, and presents a comparison of simulation results with test beam data recorded with hybrid pixel detectors. Emphasis is placed on the performance of the framework itself, using a first-principles simulation of the detectors without addressing secondary ASIC-specific effects.}

abstract = {In this article we study the potential of the MCP-PMT read-out to detect single photo-electron using transmission lines. Such a solution limits the number of read-out channels, has a uniform time resolution across the PMT surface and provides quasi-continuous measurement of the spatial coordinates. The proposed solution is designed to be used in the BOLD-PET project aiming to develop an innovative detection module for the positron emission tomography using the liquid detection media, the tri-methyl bismuth. In this study we use the commercial MCP-PMT Planacon from Photonis, with 32x32 anode structure. The PCB gathers signals from anode pads in 32 transmission lines which are read-out from both ends. Amplifier boards and SAMPIC modules, developed in our labs, allow us to perform the cost-effective, multi-channel digitization of signals with excellent precision. For a single photo-electron, we measured a time resolution of 70 ps (FWHM) simultaneously with a spatial accuracy of 1.6 mm and 0.9 mm (FWHM) along and across transmission lines correspondingly.}

It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here.}
