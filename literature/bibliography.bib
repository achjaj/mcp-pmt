abstract = {An analytical saturation model for secondary electron multiplier detectors (SEM) has been developed. This model describes SEM detector operation at high output currents when the significant part of the conduction current of dynodes passes to the electron avalanche current and the dynode potential is nonuniformly redistributed. The following main parameters of the SEM detectors in the saturated mode are predicted: the output current, conduction current and gain depending on input current, the potential, electric field and electron avalanche current distribution along the dynode system. A novel type of the SEM with nonlinear dynode resistance (SEM-NDR) that provides an extended dynamic range is suggested. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. The samples of the SEM-NDR have also been developed and investigated.}

The resulting fast high‐gain photon detectors, such as photomultipliers and electron multipliers, are among the fastest and most sensitive devices for recording the collision of a photon (or electron, atom or energetic ion) with a target surface. These detectors have gained wide acceptance in research instrumentation, particularly in mass spectroscopy and scintillation spectroscopy, as well as in optical ranging and optical communication systems. Recently a new—faster, less noisy and more efficient—type of radiation detector has been developed, consisting of a plate traversed by a large number of microscopic channels that serve as electron multipliers.}",

    abstract = {We derive, discuss, and test against experimental data an analytical model of the gain saturation in microchannel plate (MCP) devices. By introducing a simple recharging circuit for each dynode, we extend the well‐known, unsaturated gain model of Eberhardt to a microchannel operating in condition of gain saturation and show that the amplification of a current pulse and the voltage drop along the channel can be described by a pair of coupled differential equations. Solutions of these equations are given in various conditions, including an approximate solution, valid in the case of weak saturation and a general solution in implicit form. The behavior of a microchannel operating in current mode is studied by finding the transient and steady‐state solutions obtained with an input step current wave form. Exact solutions are given for the charge gain of pulses with a short duration, compared to the dynode recharging time, and for the gain recovery of a microchannel after the amplification of a short pulse. The single channel saturation model is then extended to multistage MCP assemblies by taking into account the statistical distribution of the photoelectrons at the input and the spread of the multiplied electron cloud in the interplate gaps. The expressions found in this way are used for the best fit of experimental data from a Z‐stack MCP photomultiplier operated in single and double pulse mode. Satisfactory agreement between the model and experimental data is obtained in the case of single pulse measurements, finding a reduced chi squared χ2=4.67. Less satisfactory agreement is found for double pulse data, giving χ2=7.46 and a clear indication that the model may be significantly improved by taking into account the charge redistribution among the dynodes during the recharging process, neglected in the present formulation.},

The performances of the PMT's were measured: QE was stable up to an integrated amount of anode output charge of 2–3C/cm2, while keeping other basic performances steady, such as the time resolution for single photons (σTTS) of ≃40ps, a photoelectron collection efficiency (CE) of 60%, a multiplication gain (G) of a few ×106, and dark counts of 20–300Hz. The causes of QE degradation are discussed.}

However, exposure to CO, which is known as a harmful gas to various photocathodes, has little effect on the photocathode stability. Furthermore, the effects of these gases on the restoration of the photocurrent by additional cesium deposition are investigated.

To improve the test efficiency, we proposed a test scheme to evaluate the magnetic immunity through the shift of the signal pulse height with the magnetic field. The results show that when the sensor axis is parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, the magnetic field tolerance of the sensor is up to 5 T and 1.85 T, respectively. Besides, the time resolution of the sensor is not affected by the magnetic field strength under fixed conditions.}

The compact channel structure results in high spatial and time resolutions and robustness to magnetic fields. Micro-channel plates have been originally developed for night vision applications and integrated as an amplification element in image intensifiers. These devices show single-photon sensitivity with very low noise and have been used as such for scintillating fiber tracker readout in high-energy physics experiments. Given their very short transit time spread, micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes are also being used in time-of-flight and particle identification detectors. The present paper will cover the history of the micro-channel plate development, basic features, and some of their applications. Emphasis will be put on various new manufacturing processes that have been developed over the last few years, and that result in a significant improvement in terms of efficiency, noise, and lifetime performance.}

Novel MCP technology using borosilicate glass microcapillary array substrates functionalized by the application of resistive and secondary emissive layers using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques has the potential to outperform traditional MCP technology. Using ALD techniques to functionalize the MCPs allow customization of parameters like gain and resistance independently from the glass substrate. Borosilicate substrates have many advantages over traditional micro-capillary arrays, including low radioactive content, higher open area ratios, low outgassing, and high operational stability. These ALD MCPs can be manufactured in large areas (400 cm2) providing a unique solution for many timing/imaging applications. ALD MCPs can withstand the processing temperatures required for high temperature deposition of III–V materials, such as Gallium Nitride, for UV photocathodes with high quantum efficiencies (QE) in the Near-UV (∼100–380 nm). We present the effects of different ALD configurations on the gain (magnitude and uniformity), resistance, imaging, background and detection efficiency, and how these parameters change during lifetime testing. We also present the QE of ALD MCPs and various QE enhancement techniques.}

A new MCP fabrication method combines a glass substrate composed of hollow glass capillary arrays with thin film coatings to provide the resistive and secondary electron emissive properties. Using this technique, the gain, resistance, and glass properties may be chosen independently. Large-area MCPs are available at moderate cost. Secondary emission films of Al2O3 and MgO provide sustained high gain as charge is extracted from the MCP. Long lifetimes are possible, and a total extracted charge of 7 C/cm2 has been demonstrated. Background rates are low because the glass substrate has little radioactive potassium 40. Curved MCPs are easily fabricated with this technique to suit instrument symmetries, simplifying secondary electron steering and smoothing azimuthal efficiency.},

abstract = {Atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating of microchannel plates (MCP) has been shown to offer significant performance advantages in MCP-PMTs (MCP Photomultiplier Tube). ALD is a chemical vapour process used to deposit atomic mono-layers on a substrate. A process has been developed to deposit a surface with improved secondary emission yield (SEY) on to an MCP substrate. The principal advantage of a higher SEY is the ability to achieve significantly higher gain at the same operating voltage across a single MCP. Further to this, it is suspected the atomic mono-layers deposited by ALD coating prevent desorption of gaseous contaminants in the MCP glass. The ions produced during desorption are widely believed to be a direct cause of photocathode ageing in MCP-PMTs, leading to the hope that ALD coating can improve the MCP-PMT lifetime. To fully characterise the performance of ALD coated MCPs, two MCP-PMTs were manufactured, one ALD coated and the other uncoated to be used as a reference. Each detector's gain, DQE, pulse shape and timing jitter were measured followed by a life test of the tubes. The ALD coated tube was found to have a higher gain at the same operating voltage, whilst being equivalent to a standard MCP in other performance characteristics. ALD coating gave a dramatically improved life time, after 5.16Ccm−2 total charge extracted, there was no measurable effect on the photocathode QE, although the MCP gain dropped by approximately 35%.}

We have also developed a new MCP-PMT with Hamamatsu photonics, that adopts a super bialkali photocathode. Currently a peak quantum effciency of 28% for 400nm photons has been achieved.}

abstract = {We have developed 1-inch square-shaped Micro-Channel-Plate PMT (MCP-PMT) for the barrel particle identification detector, named Time-Of-Propagation (TOP) detector, at the Belle II experiment. The TOP detector utilizes the precise timing measurement to reconstruct the charged particle velocity through the Cherenkov ring image and the time-of-flight information. The MCP-PMT realizes the timing measurement with <40 ps precision for single photon detection. We have tested over 600 MCP-PMTs including spares, and installed 512 of those into the Belle II TOP detector. Along with the mass production, we have studied to improve the MCP-PMT photocathode lifetime. By applying Atomic-Layer-Deposition (ALD) technique on MCP and further residual gas reduction process, the lifetime have improved significantly. The improved PMTs are also installed. To understand the mechanism of photocathode deterioration, we have measured feed-backed ion’s signals using developed MCP-PMTs and studied the correlation between the rate and the lifetime.}

Two DIRC detectors with their image planes residing in an ∼1T magnetic field will be used in the experiment. The only suitable photon detectors for both DIRCs were identified to be Microchannel-Plate Photomultipliers (MCP-PMTs). Since the aging problems of MCP-PMTs were solved recently by coating the MCPs with the so-called ALD-technique (atomic layer depostion) we are investigating devices which are significantly improved with respect to other parameters, as, e.g., the collection efficiency (CE) and the quantum efficiency (QE). The latest generation of MCP-PMTs can reach a detective quantum efficiency DQE=QE⋅ CE of  30%. This paper will present the performance of the most advanced 53 × 53 mm2 ALD-coated MCP-PMTs from Photonis (8 × 8 and 3 × 100 anodes) and Photek (8 × 8 anodes), also inside the magnetic field. With a picosecond laser and a multi-hit capable DAQ system which allows read out up to 300 pixels simultaneously, parameters like darkcount rate, afterpulse probability and time resolution can be investigated as a function of incident photon position.}

The small effective open area of microchannel plates (MCPs) increases the probability of photoelectrons bouncing on the front surface of MCPs and aggravates late pulses. In this work, a three-dimensional MCP-PMT model is developed in CST particle studio, a powerful electromagnetic field simulation program, to evaluate the effects of secondary emission yield (SEY) property of the MCP input facet and electric field on the photoelectron backscattering. Timing properties and the number of collected electrons are extracted without smearing due to electronic noise and finite pulse width. Results predict that the collection efficiency (CE) and the time performance can be improved by coating the MCP Nickel–Chromium input electrode with a high SEY material and operating in a proper photocathode-MCP bias voltage.}

It is shown that the reduced secondary emission yield δδm as a function of the reduced primary energy EpEm can be described by a universal curve. It is found that it is easier to use the measurement of the maximum secondary electron emission δm and the energy Em at which this maximum is reached to determine the suitability of a coating for use in the display than direct measurement of the first crossover energy EI. The value of δm and Em can be used to derive EI. Furthermore, it is observed that in any material the elastic fraction of the secondary electrons exhibits a universal behaviour as a function of Ep. Fits to δ(Ep) and the energy distribution of the secondary electrons are proposed which can be used in Monte Carlo simulations.}

For improvement of the photocathode lifetime the PMT with three MCPs has been developed. A procedure of the fast test of the photocathode aging has been developed. Using this test allowed us to improve the production technology and decrease the rate of the photocathode aging by about order of magnitude. In axial magnetic field of 1.5T gain of the triple MCP PMT decreases by about 3 times, photoelectron collection efficiency does not change. The time resolution for single photon of 35ps has been obtained.}

This chapter discusses the energy distribution of the output electrons (EDOE) characteristics of a single-channel electron multiplier (CEM). It describes microchannel plate (MCP) with new experimental results. The fundamental EDOE characteristics of an MCP are measured. This study provides direct information on the output energy spread that is very important for various applications of an MCP, especially for imaging devices. It has been found that the EDOE of an MCP behaves very similarly to that of a CEM with an internal output electrode. Thus, the MCP gain is greatly affected by the penetration depth of the electrode into the microchannels (as in a CEM). The EDOE consists of a sharp main peak and an undesirable subpeak extending over a wide energy range.}
